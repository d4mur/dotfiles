# My XFCE Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal XFCE dotfiles used to customize the look and feel of my desktop environment. These configurations reflect my individual preferences and setup.

## Contents

- **`gtk.css`**: Custom stylesheet for adjusting the appearance of the XFCE4 panel.

- **`conky`**: Conky configuration files, specifically the **FieryInsight** setup. This configuration provides a detailed and stylish system monitor display, featuring:
  - A side panel with blocks displaying system stats, GPU details, RAM usage, and more.
  - Colorful graphics and fonts designed for a clear, dynamic overview of system performance.

- **`genmon-button script`**: A script for the Genmon plugin to add a button for logging out of the XFCE session.

## Note

These dotfiles represent my personal setup and preferences. Feel free to use them as inspiration for your own customizations if you find them useful.
